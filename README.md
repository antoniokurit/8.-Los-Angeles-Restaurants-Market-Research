# 8.-Los-Angeles-Restaurants-Market-Research.ipynb

We opened a small robort-run cafe in Los Angeles, and will be conducting market research for investors.

We will analyze open-source data on restaurants in LA, which will give us insight of the current market conditions for robot-run cafes. We will investigate various aspects of the restaurants in our dataset, and make conclusions and/or conjectures.

Our analysis will be synthezied into a presentation ready to be shared with investors.
